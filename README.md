# Steganography
Steganography  is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography comes from New Latin steganographia, which combines the Greek words steganós (στεγανός), meaning "covered or concealed", and Latin -graphia (-graphia) meaning "writing".[1]
